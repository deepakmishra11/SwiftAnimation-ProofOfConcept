# SwiftAnimation-Proof-Of-Concept

A small effort to learn how easy or simple is to play with UIBezierPath , CoreAnimation using swift.

    - UIBezierPath is used to draw line/shape.
    - CoreAnimation is used to animate bezier path.

This example shows the basic usage of CoreAnimation APIs.

All the animation is worked on CAShapeLayer(iOS 8.0 and above).
